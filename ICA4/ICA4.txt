11.Is the current method of saving the classifier blocking to the tornado IOLoop? Justify your response.
Yes it does. In order to save the model, we have to train the model and the training phase blocks the tornado IOLoop.

12. Would the models saved on one server be useable by another server if we migrated the saved documents in MongoDB? Justify your response.
No. Because the model is saved in a data folder separate from MongoDB. However, we could retrain the model from the migrated MongoDB data and train the new model individually.
